## Introduction of Travelling salesman problem

"The **travelling salesman problem** (**TSP**) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?" It is an [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)problem in [combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization)." (**more details on** [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem))
